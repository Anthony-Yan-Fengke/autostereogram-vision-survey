# Autostereogram Visual Perception Survey

This is a personal project I conducted during high school, aiming to explore how different linear spacings in **autostereograms** affect human recognition accuracy and response time. Although the project was initiated in my earlier learning stage, I intentionally kept the original ideas, language, and mistakes to reflect the learning process and growth.

## Project Summary

- Designed and distributed an online questionnaire using Google Forms with embedded timers
- Included stereogram images generated with varying linear spacings (divisors 10–50)
- Collected participant responses including observed images and time taken to perceive them
- Iteratively improved the questionnaire design based on feedback from early participants
- Analyzed recognition rates and average response time across different stereograms
- Summarized the project into a research-style poster and report

## Inspiration

This project was inspired by a video about Magic Eye (autostereogram) illusions. Curious about how they worked, I began researching the principles behind depth maps and stereogram generation. Though I had no formal training in vision science at the time, I challenged myself to design a real-world survey, generate examples, and draw conclusions from participant feedback.

## What I Learned

- How to design a perception-based questionnaire and iteratively refine it
- Basic principles behind stereoscopic vision and depth maps
- How to handle user response data and visualize survey results
- Importance of usability, instruction clarity, and timing design in research
- English ability improved
