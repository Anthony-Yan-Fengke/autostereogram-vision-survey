# 🧠 Autostereogram Visual Perception Survey

This is a high school project conducted independently, aiming to investigate how different linear spacings in autostereograms affect human recognition accuracy and response time.

## 📌 Project Summary

- Designed a digital questionnaire using Google Forms with embedded timers.
- Included stereogram images with varying linear spacing (divisors 10–50).
- Collected participant feedback on perceived 3D objects and time taken.
- Iteratively improved the questionnaire structure based on initial user feedback.
- Final results were summarized in a report with explanations of stereogram principles and research reflections.

## 📊 Files Included

- `questionnaire_zh.docx`: Original Chinese version of the perception questionnaire.
- `questionnaire_en.docx`: English translation of the same questionnaire.
- `report_autostereogram.pdf`: Full project report in English.
- `data/responses.xlsx`: Raw participant data.
- `data/charts/recognition_rate.png`: Recognition result chart.
- `data/charts/avg_response_time.png`: Average response time chart.

> 🔤 Note: Some materials were originally written in Chinese as this was conducted in a Chinese-speaking environment. English translations and summaries are provided to make the project accessible to a wider audience.

## 🔎 Inspiration

The idea came from a video about autostereograms, which sparked curiosity about how such illusions work and whether computer science knowledge could be applied to generate and analyze them.
