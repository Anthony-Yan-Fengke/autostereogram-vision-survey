# Acknowledgements

This project was conducted during my high school studies as a personal exploration of visual perception and computer science.

I would like to sincerely thank the following individuals and resources:

- **My Classmates**: For helping me process and organize the participant data in Excel format.
- **Participants**: For taking the time to complete the questionnaire and provide valuable feedback.
- **Easy Stereogram Builder** (https://www.easystereogrambuilder.com/): For inspiration and some of the stereogram image generation methods.
- **Stinson, L.** and the article ["The hidden history of Magic Eye"](https://eyeondesign.aiga.org/the-hidden-history-of-magic-eye-the-optical-illusion-that-briefly-took-over-the-world/): Provided background insights into the origins of autostereograms.
- **My teacher(s)** who supported this project and offered feedback during the early stages.

This project taught me the value of iterative design, user testing, and how to approach a technical problem with both scientific thinking and user-centered design.
